# Making an instrument !!

soooo cool : https://csound.com/docs/manual/lorenz.html

15h06: I am quite satisfied with my first instrument based on the Lorenz system of equations.

I think I will compile a bunch of these .wav files that are generated by Csound in an album-like compilation, at the end of the residence.

## Random thoughts

Although I have been dabbling in various sound libraries for some years now, I never really took the time to really understand the systems I was working with. I always felt overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn, and especially about where to even start with them ! Sound synthesis and instrument design is a vast field of knowledge; there are so many dimensions to sound, and it is still difficult for me to know where to start.

Writing these notes and dedicating time to this is helping me a lot already, even though I have just started my residency. I am quite enthusiastic at the idea of pursuing these ideas this week!

I am planning on releasing selected works done this week at the end of the week or next week. I will keep you updated with this.


## What about tomorrow ?

Tomorrow:

- continuing the Csound TOOTorial
- experimenting with the instruments in the TOOTorial
- reading about Lorenz system of equation
- continuing the design of my instrument based on these informations
- write about my day!
